# 🔒 Password Verification Form

A simple password verification form built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project ensures that users input matching passwords before submitting the form.

## 📋 Project Overview

The form contains the following fields:
- **Username** input
- **Password** input
- **Re-type Password** input
- **Verify/Submit** button

When the user clicks the **Verify** button:
- The script checks if both password fields match.
- If they match, a success message appears.
- If they don't match, an error message is displayed, preventing submission.

This basic functionality is essential for any registration form where password confirmation is required.
